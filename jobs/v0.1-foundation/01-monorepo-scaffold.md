# Task: Monorepo scaffold + core types (Track 1 — Foundation)

**Job:** v0.1-foundation
**Group:** scaffold
**Branch:** `job/v0.1-foundation/scaffold-monorepo`
**Mode:** Worker (single-task)
**Blocks:** Tracks 2, 3, 4, 5 — every other worker depends on `@onegov/core/types`

---

## Mission

Stand up the Bun-workspaces monorepo so subsequent tracks can begin in parallel. The unblocking event is committing a **complete, typed, exported `packages/core/src/types.ts`** matching `SPEC.md §5.1`. Everything else (Vite config, manifest skeleton, empty bundle producing a loadable Chrome extension) is supporting work that proves the build pipeline functions end-to-end.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Root `package.json` declares Bun workspaces: `packages/*`
- [ ] `tsconfig.base.json` with strict mode + project references
- [ ] Three workspace packages exist with their own `package.json` + `tsconfig.json`:
  - [ ] `@onegov/core` — pure TS, no DOM, no browser globals; depends only on `psl`, `idna-uts46-hx`, `zod`
  - [ ] `@onegov/ui` — depends on Preact + `@onegov/core`
  - [ ] `@onegov/extension` — depends on `@onegov/core`, `@onegov/ui`; the only package allowed `chrome.*`
- [ ] **`packages/core/src/types.ts` is complete** per `SPEC.md §5.1`: `VerifiedDomain`, `VerifiedDomainList`, `DomainStatus`, `Persona`, `RulePack`, `Route`, `PersonaOverride`, `ExtractRule`, `SerializableDoc`, `SerializableEl`, `SemanticTree`, `SemanticNode`. All exported via `packages/core/src/index.ts` barrel.
- [ ] Each package's `src/index.ts` exists (barrels); other module files may be empty stubs that re-export `// TODO` placeholders only where required to make builds pass
- [ ] `packages/extension/vite.config.ts` configured for three entries (`background`, `content`, `popup`) outputting to root `dist/extension/`
- [ ] `packages/extension/src/manifest.json` matches `SPEC.md §5.3` skeleton — but `host_permissions` and `content_scripts.matches` start with the **v0.1 ship list** from `SITES_COVERAGE.md §8`:
  ```
  *://*.anaf.ro/*
  *://dgep.mai.gov.ro/*
  *://*.depabd.mai.gov.ro/*
  *://portal.just.ro/*
  *://*.ghiseul.ro/*
  *://*.rotld.ro/*
  *://itmcluj.ro/*
  ```
- [ ] Root `package.json` scripts:
  - [ ] `bun run check` — typecheck all packages (no lint yet, that's a follow-up)
  - [ ] `bun run build` — runs Vite build in `packages/extension`
  - [ ] `bun run validate-packs` — runs `scripts/validate-packs.ts` (script may be a no-op stub for now since no packs exist yet, but must exit 0 cleanly)
- [ ] `bun install` succeeds on a clean clone
- [ ] `bun run check` succeeds
- [ ] `bun run build` produces `dist/extension/` containing at minimum `manifest.json`, `background.js`, `content.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.js` — even if the JS files are essentially empty
- [ ] The unpacked `dist/extension/` loads in **Chrome** without error (no console errors in service worker or extension page)
- [ ] The unpacked `dist/extension/` loads in **Firefox** via `bunx web-ext run --source-dir dist/extension/` without error
- [ ] `.eslintrc.cjs` and `.prettierrc.json` committed at root (basic config; the custom invariant lint rules from `CODING.md §Tooling` can be added in a follow-up task)
- [ ] Empty `scripts/` dir contains `validate-packs.ts` stub
- [ ] Empty `rule-packs/` dir contains `_verified-domains.json` with just `{ "version": "0.0.0", "updatedAt": "<today>", "domains": [] }` (so packs validation has something to load even before Track 5 lands)
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` initialized with the architecture diagram from `CLAUDE.md §Architecture Overview`
- [ ] `docs/LOG.md` initialized with one entry for this task

---

## Required tests

Per `CLAUDE.md §Step 3`, every task needs tests. For this scaffold:

- [ ] `packages/core/tests/types.test.ts` — type-level test that imports every exported type and constructs a minimal valid value. Confirms the public API exists and the barrel works. Use `bun test`.
- [ ] `packages/core/tests/no-dom.test.ts` — smoke test asserting `@onegov/core` can be imported in a pure-Node context with no `document`/`window`/`chrome` globals available (assertion: `globalThis.document === undefined` after import).
- [ ] Root `bun test` runs the suite and exits 0.

---

## Hard constraints (read CLAUDE.md before starting)

- **Five invariants are not testable yet** (no runtime), but `manifest.json` must already encode invariants 4 + 5: minimal `host_permissions` (only ship-list domains), minimal `permissions` (`storage`, `scripting`, `activeTab`, `webNavigation` only — nothing else).
- **No `chrome.*` outside `packages/extension`.**
- **No new runtime dependencies** beyond: `preact`, `psl`, `idna-uts46-hx`, `zod`. Dev deps allowed: `typescript`, `vite`, `@types/chrome`, `@types/firefox-webext-browser`, `web-ext`, `prettier`, `eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/*`.
- **MAX 500 lines per file.**
- **TypeScript strict, no `any`.**
- **English in code; Romanian only in user-facing UI text** (none yet — this is scaffold).
- **No `Co-Authored-By` in commits.**

## What you will report back

After completion, write `jobs/v0.1-foundation/DONE-01-monorepo-scaffold.md` per `CLAUDE.md §Step 4`.

Include in your final summary to the orchestrator:
1. Branch name and commit hashes
2. Output of `bun run check`, `bun test`, `bun run build` (paste tail)
3. Confirmation extension loaded in Chrome and Firefox (one screenshot or "loaded clean" line each)
4. Any deviations from this spec (with justification)
5. List of follow-up work that should be its own task (e.g. invariant lint rules, icon generation script)

---

## Out of scope (deferred to later tasks)

- Implementation of `domain-verifier.ts`, `lookalike.ts`, `rule-pack-loader.ts`, `semantic-extractor.ts`, `persona.ts` (Track 2)
- Preact components and persona variants (Track 3)
- Background service worker logic, content script Preact mounting, popup UI (Track 4)
- Actual rule packs and the verified domain roster (Track 5)
- Custom invariant ESLint rules, icon generation, packaging scripts (follow-up tasks)
- E2E test fixtures (Playwright comes after Track 4)
